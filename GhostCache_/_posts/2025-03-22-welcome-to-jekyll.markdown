### **Course Script: Python in 60 Minutes**

---

#### **Introduction to Python (5 minutes)**

**Instructor Script:**
"Welcome to 'Python in 60 Minutes: From Zero to Hero!' My name is [Your Name], and Iâ€™ll be your guide today. By the end of this session, youâ€™ll have a solid understanding of Python basics and even build a small project!

Letâ€™s start with the basics: **What is Python?**  
Python is a high-level, easy-to-learn programming language. Itâ€™s used for everything from web development to data science, automation, and even artificial intelligence.  

**Why learn Python?**  
- Itâ€™s beginner-friendly and has simple, readable syntax.  
- Itâ€™s versatile and widely used in industries like finance, healthcare, and tech.  
- It has a huge community, so there are tons of resources and libraries to help you.  

**Real-world applications:**  
- Data analysis with tools like Pandas and NumPy.  
- Automating repetitive tasks, like renaming files or sending emails.  
- Building websites with frameworks like Django or Flask.  

Letâ€™s dive in and get started!"

#### **Setting Up the Environment (5 minutes)**

**Instructor Script:**
"Before we start coding, we need to set up our environment.  

1. **Install Python:**  
   - Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/) and download the latest version of Python (3.x).  
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.  

2. **Install an IDE:**  
   - An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is where we write and run our code.  
   - I recommend **VS Code** or **Jupyter Notebook** for beginners.  
   - Download and install one of these tools.  

3. **Write your first program:**  
   - Open your IDE and type:  
     ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```  
   - Run the program. If you see 'Hello, World!' printed, youâ€™re ready to go!"

#### **Python Basics (15 minutes)**

**Instructor Script:**
"Now that weâ€™re set up, letâ€™s learn some Python basics.  

1. **Variables and Data Types:**  
   - Variables store data. For example:  
     ```python
     name = "Alice"
     age = 25
     height = 5.6
     is_student = True
     ```  
   - Python has several data types:  
     - Strings (text): `"Hello"`  
     - Integers (whole numbers): `10`  
     - Floats (decimal numbers): `3.14`  
     - Booleans (True/False): `True`  

2. **Basic Operations:**  
   - Arithmetic:  
     ```python
     x = 10
     y = 3
     print(x + y)  # Addition
     print(x - y)  # Subtraction
     print(x * y)  # Multiplication
     print(x / y)  # Division
     ```  
   - String concatenation:  
     ```python
     first_name = "John"
     last_name = "Doe"
     full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
     print(full_name)
     ```  

3. **Input and Output:**  
   - Use `input()` to get user input:  
     ```python
     name = input("Enter your name: ")
     print("Hello, " + name)
     ```  
   - Use `print()` to display output:  
     ```python
     print("This is a message.")
     ```  

Letâ€™s practice! Try creating a program that asks for the userâ€™s name and age, then prints a message like:  
`Hello [name], you are [age] years old.`"

---

#### **Control Flow (10 minutes)**

**Instructor Script:**
"Now letâ€™s learn how to control the flow of your program.  

1. **Conditional Statements:**  
   - Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make decisions:  
     ```python
     age = 18
     if age >= 18:
         print("You are an adult.")
     else:
         print("You are a minor.")
     ```  

2. **Loops:**  
   - Use `for` loops to repeat actions:  
     ```python
     for i in range(5):
         print("Iteration:", i)
     ```  
   - Use `while` loops to repeat until a condition is met:  
     ```python
     count = 0
     while count < 3:
         print("Count:", count)
         count += 1
     ```  

Letâ€™s practice! Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop."

---

#### **Functions (10 minutes)**

**Instructor Script:**
"Functions are reusable blocks of code. Letâ€™s learn how to create and use them.  

1. **Defining and Calling Functions:**  
   - Use `def` to define a function:  
     ```python
     def greet():
         print("Hello, World!")
     ```  
   - Call the function:  
     ```python
     greet()
     ```  

2. **Parameters and Return Values:**  
   - Pass data to functions using parameters:  
     ```python
     def greet(name):
         print("Hello, " + name)
     greet("Alice")
     ```  
   - Return values from functions:  
     ```python
     def add(a, b):
         return a + b
     result = add(3, 5)
     print(result)
     ```  

Letâ€™s practice! Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum."

---

#### **Real-World Mini-Project (10 minutes)**

**Instructor Script:**
"Letâ€™s put everything together and build a **Number Guessing Game**!  

Hereâ€™s how it works:  
1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.  
2. The user guesses the number.  
3. The program tells the user if their guess is too high or too low.  
4. The game continues until the user guesses correctly.  

Hereâ€™s the code:  
```python
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    number = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0

    while True:
        guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))
        attempts += 1

        if guess < number:
            print("Too low!")
        elif guess > number:
            print("Too high!")
        else:
            print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.")
            break

number_guessing_game()
```  

Letâ€™s run this together and see who can guess the number in the fewest attempts!"
